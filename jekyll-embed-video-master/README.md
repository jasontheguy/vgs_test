# jekyll-embed-video
Embed YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Streamable, Mixer, Google Drive videos/clips and more in Jekyll webpages without a plugin. If you are hosting your webpage using GitHub pages, you can't use third party plugins. Here is a method to use "includes" instead of plugins.

See the raw text in `example.md` for a complete example. Remember to add in [video-embed.css](https://github.com/nathancy/jekyll-embed-video/blob/master/video-embed.css) for [responsive videos](#responsive-videos) that automatically resize with changing window dimensions.

## Embed Google Drive 

Embedding Google Drive videos have additional steps. 

1. For the desired video, change the link sharing setting to `On - Anyone with the link`. This will make the video accessible to anyone who has the link as no sign-in is required. 
  
  **Important**: If you do not change the video setting to this option, your video will not show.
  
2. Double click the video to show the preview. Click the setting options and select "Open in new window". Now click on the setting option again and select "Embed item". The iframe code should appear. For example:

```
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EC8BnjJMon-vqy-UhLKk9sf_oukZzEbP/preview"></iframe>
```

`1EC8BnjJMon-vqy-UhLKk9sf_oukZzEbP/preview` would be your video ID.

**Note**: Right clicking the video will not bring up the embed option. You must open the video in a new window. 

Create a file in your `_includes` folder called `googleDrivePlayer.html` with this code inside: 

```
<div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
      width="640"
      height="480"
      src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/{{ include.id }}"
      frameborder="0"
      allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>
```

Place this snippet inside your .md file where you want to embed your video:

```
{% include googleDrivePlayer.html id=page.driveId %}
```

On the top of your .md file, put the Google Drive video ID. You could also put the ID of the video directly.
